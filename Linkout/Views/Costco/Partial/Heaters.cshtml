            Carbon fiber seat heater can be installed in your car seats under your new upholstery. Features thin, flexible cloth-like pads. Auto manufacturers use carbon fiber in factory seat heater systems. Pad style is traditionally larger than wired element pads. Provides more comfortable heat disbursement than wired-element systems. Designed for seats with horizontal listings and can be trimmed and holes cut to accommodate installation in varied vehicles.
